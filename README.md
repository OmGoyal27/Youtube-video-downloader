Hi everyone! This project is for those guys who want to download a YouTube video in the form of audio or video. I have originally made this for my personal use so that I could download songs from it.
This is not a fancy gui project or something. It is just a simple little project that is used to interact with the YouTube and you could interact with it through the command line.
